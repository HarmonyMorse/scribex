Technical Architecture for ScribeX: AI-Powered Writing Education Platform
This report analyzes optimal technology choices for building ScribeX's microservice architecture, focusing on AI integration strategies for grammar analysis, prompt generation, and automated grading while addressing the outlined user stories and accessibility requirements.

Foundational Backend Architecture
Python FastAPI Microservices
FastAPI provides asynchronous capabilities critical for handling concurrent user interactions in educational environments1. Key components:

Database Layer: PostgreSQL with asyncpg driver for high-concurrency IEP goal tracking and narrative storage

ORM: SQLAlchemy 2.0+ with asynchronous support for complex queries across student portfolios1

Validation: Pydantic V2 models ensuring data integrity for IEP accommodations and progress tracking

Background Tasks: Celery with Redis broker for AI processing queues (grammar analysis, prompt generation)

API Gateway: Traefik with JWT authentication for role-based access control (teachers/admins/parents)

```python
# Sample FastAPI endpoint for IEP-compliant prompt generation
@app.post("/prompts/iep")
async def generate_iep_prompt(
    student: Annotated[Student, Depends(validate_iep_access)],
    curriculum: CurriculumBase
):
    ai_prompt = build_iep_prompt(
        student.learning_goals,
        student.accommodations
    )
    generated = await grammar_ai.generate(
        prompt=ai_prompt,
        temperature=0.3
    )
    return sanitize_output(generated, student.accessibility_needs)
```

  <GrammarChecker provider={selectedGrammarAI} />
  <IEPVisualization goals={currentIEP} />
</WritingInterface>
```

Prompt Generation Architecture
Base Templates: JSON-LD structured prompts with W3C accessibility metadata

AI Enhancement:

Validation Pipeline:

```text
graph TD
A[Curriculum Template] --> B(AI Expansion)
B --> C(IEP Compliance Check)
C --> D(Teacher Approval Queue)
D --> E(Student Delivery)
```
Automated Grading Microservice
Gradescope API5: Batch processing of writing assignments

Graded Pro: Real-time progress tracking against IEP benchmarks

Custom NLP: SpaCy pipelines analyzing writing complexity growth

Feedback System:
```python
def generate_feedback(student: StudentData) -> Feedback:
    grammar_errors = grammar_check(student.writing)
    progress = calculate_iep_progress(student.metrics)
    narrative = build_story_continuation(student.portfolio)
    
    return Feedback(
        corrections=grammar_errors,
        growth_metrics=progress,
        story_update=narrative
    )
```
Frontend Implementation Strategy
React Core Architecture
State Management: Jotai for IEP tracking context

Accessibility: React-aria components with WCAG 2.2 compliance

Narrative Visualization: D3.js for story path mapping

Mobile Support: React Native Web for cross-platform rendering
```javascript
// Adaptive learning component
<AdaptiveLesson>
  <IEPGoalsTracker />
  <StoryTimeline chapters={user.portfolio} />
  <WritingCanvas 
    assistiveTech={user.iep.assistive_tech} 
    autoFormat={formats[user.iep.format_preference]}
  />
</AdaptiveLesson>
```

Data Management Considerations
PostgreSQL Schema Design
```sql
CREATE TABLE iep_goals (
    goal_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id UUID REFERENCES students,
    objective TEXT NOT NULL,
    metrics JSONB,  -- Stores writing complexity scores
    accommodations JSONB  -- TTS, formatting needs, etc.
);

CREATE TABLE writing_portfolio (
    entry_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id UUID,
    narrative_chapter INTEGER,
    ai_feedback JSONB,
    CONSTRAINT story_continuity CHECK (
        narrative_chapter > (
            SELECT MAX(chapter) 
            FROM writing_portfolio 
            WHERE student_id = student_id
        )
    )
);
```

Security & Compliance Implementation
Data Protection:

AES-256 encryption for IEP documents3

HIPAA/FERPA compliant storage through PostgreSQL row security

Access Control:

RBAC with Okta integration

Parent/teacher permission delegation system

Audit Trail:
```python
@app.middleware("http")
async def iep_access_logger(request: Request, call_next):
    response = await call_next(request)
    log_iep_access(
        user=request.state.user,
        resource=request.url.path,
        timestamp=datetime.utcnow()
    )
    return response
```

AI-Assisted IEP Support System
Adaptive Learning Pipeline
Input Processing:

Voice-to-text: AssemblyAI API

Writing Style Analysis: Custom CNN models

Prompt Personalization:
```python
def build_iep_prompt(base_prompt: str, accommodations: dict) -> str:
    prompt_template = f"""
    Adapt following writing prompt for student needs:
    {base_prompt}
    
    Accommodations:
    - Format: {accommodations['format']}
    - Complexity: {accommodations['reading_level']}
    - Sensory: {accommodations['sensory_needs']}
    """
    return ai_prompt_generator(prompt_template)[4]
```

    baseline = student.portfolio[0].complexity
    current = student.portfolio[-1].complexity
    iep_target = student.iep.goals['writing_target']
    return (current - baseline) / (iep_target - baseline)
```
